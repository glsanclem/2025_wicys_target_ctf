# D6. Smuggled Away

**Points:** 500  | **Level:** More Difficult | **Category:** Network Forensics, Data Decoding

---

## Description
Aye, ye be a smart one! Looks like we found where the stolen data is being smuggled out from. Since it looks like the pirates have already stolen some of our data, can we at least find out what they stole? If it's customer data, we may have an obligation to notify the affected parties. Use your best skills to discover and what they took.

---

## Objective
Now that we see where things are being exfiltrated, provide the credit card's expiration date, CVV, and the email of the client we saw in the PCAP.

---

## Flag Format
The flag is in the format: <CreditCardExpiration>_<CVVofCreditCard>_<email>

---

## Tools Used
PCAP file (previous challenge); Wireshark; CyberChef

---

## Methodology
This task is a continuation of the previous challenge. I looked at the pcap file from D5, WireShark, and ran it through Tshark:

</p>

`tshark -r pirates.pcap -Y "ip.src == 10.75.34.13 and ip.dst == 251.91.13.37 and dns" -T fields -e dns.qry.name > extracted_queries.txt`  

Filtering the DNS query (dns.qry.name) extracted all domain names from the DNS queries in the pirates.pcap file into the domains.txt.

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Wireshark\tshark.exe" -r "C:\{Path_to}\pirates.pcap" -Y "dns.qry.name and ip.dst == {C2_IP}" -T fields -e dns.qry.name > domains.txt
```

The string of prefixes revealed lowercase letters and digits which was copied and pasted into CyberChef in the upper right quadrant. From the left side the following operations were dragged and dropped into the Recipe (To Upper case, From Base32, Gunzip) and the Output in the lower right quadrant revealed the flag answer.

## MITRE ATT&CK
<span style="color:yellow; font-style:italic;">(Suggested)</span>
This challenge was about uncovering the *what* (actual stolen data). In this case, it shifts the weight more toward:
-	**Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.003):** Here, the attacker smuggled out sensitive information by hiding it inside DNS queries, a protocol not normally used for bulk data transfer.
-	**Data Encoding (T1132):** In this case, the stolen information was encoded and compressed (Base32, GZIP) to make it harder to spot in network traffic.
-	**Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048):** Beyond normal channels like HTTP or email, the attacker used DNS as a sneaky way to transfer stolen customer data.
