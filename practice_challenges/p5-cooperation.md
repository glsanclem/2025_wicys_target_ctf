# P5. Cooperation

**Points:** 42  
**Level:** Simple  
**Category:** Collaboration

---

## Description
Our official policy on cooperation in this challenge: Go for it! In general, try to keep the challenge interesting by avoiding very direct hints. Nudge is the perfect word for the ideal way to be helping out! Instead of giving it away, try linking an article or reference that will help someone learn the background knowledge required to come to the realization themselves. It should go without saying that if there's a twist in the challenge, don't spoil it, even indirectly! As for those requesting assistance, try to be specific in what you’re stuck on to make it easier for those who’re trying to help. Yes/no questions are the way to go!

## Methodology
In this challenge, I learned that we were allowed to collaborate with others and ask for help. Collaboration allows us to understand different perspectives and help each other find the causes and solutions of a problem. Asking for help is not a weakness but allows you to figure out what you missed. In the end, it’s a learning process and we are all winners!

## MITRE ATT&CK
<span style="color:yellow; font-style:italic;">(Suggested)</span>
-	**Collaboration:** Effective collaboration requires trust between the team and individuals.
-	**Commonality:** If your team does not share a common mindset, whether red, blue, or purple team, collaborative efforts can fail.
**Challenge:** A challenge of using the Mitre Att&ck framework for collaboration is resource intensive, complexity, and overwhelming techniques that make it difficult for teams to know where to begin or what to prioritize.
