# P3.2 Limited Attempts

**Points:** 15  
**Level:** Simple  
**Category:** Tutorial  

---

## Description
Some challenges are broken up into sub-challenges. They give less points, but in total they will amount to a full challenge's worth. We're running out of fun ideas for intro flags, so this one is uhh, "submarine sandwich." Most challenges will allow unlimited tries, but some have a limit due to design constraints. In other words, it might be kinda easy to guess and we can't have you getting away with that. You'll see "x/x Attempts" at the top of these. For this one, you get 100 attempts. Unlocking a hint may direct you towards that vital piece of information. None of the challenges with limited attempts will require any guessing. There may be things that look correct, but they all have only one truly correct answer.

## Objective
Guess which number I'm thinking of, 1-10! And then please never try to guess an answer like this again! NO TRICKS HERE. Please don't overthink this!

## Tools Used
**Cognitive tools**: CEO of the brain, working memory, selective attention, decoding

## Methodology
This challenge was similar to the previous one, P3.1. It required not to second-guess things. Again, sometimes the answer is very simple and as someone with an overactive mind ideas and monkey-chattering thoughts, it was hard not to overanalyze: “I know you are telling me there are no tricks here, to not overthink…but…maybe…” Nope, that one second you took to think “maybe” was enough for another defender to move ahead of you. Literally, this challenge required not to overthink things. The rules were clear and simple, and for only 15 points, I quickly chose a number and moved it along.

## MITRE ATT&CK
<span style="color:yellow; font-style:italic;">(Suggested)</span>
- **TTP**: Out cognitive skills are trained to recognize the simplicity of a challenge and analyze whether this was a manipulative tactic or simple instructions. We used critical thinking, analytical skills, and attention control in this challenge. 
- **Mitigation + Detection**: Using mindfulness, awareness of own strengths and weakness, and controlling your own attention is paramount to threat detection.
