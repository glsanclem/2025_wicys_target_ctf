### P3.1 Sub-Challenge

**Points:** 15  
**Level:** Simple  
**Category:** Tutorial  

**Description:**  
Some challenges are broken up into sub-challenges. They give fewer points, but in total they will amount to a full challenge's worth. We're running out of fun ideas for intro flags, so this one is uhh, "submarine sandwich".  

**Objective / Challenge:**  
Obtain the flag by reading and following instructions.  

**Tools Used:**  
Cognitive tools: CEO of the brain, working memory, selective attention, decoding  

**Methodology + Solution:**  
This was a simple challenge but packed with substantive knowledge. To obtain the flag, I used my cognitive tools. I thought, “well, I am the CEO of my brain” and with a perfectly functional memory and selective attention, I was able to swiftly decode the simple message—read, don’t overthink, and move it along. Wallah!! The answer was in quotation marks.  

**Flag:**  
`submarine sandwich`  

**Mitre Att&ck:**  
- **TTP:** As a defender, the challenge was not to use a cognitive attack but to train my own cognitive skills to recognize and counter the manipulative tactic in the challenge. A defender may overthink a scenario believing there is more to it, when the answer is clear, simple, and taken at face value. This challenge allowed me to use critical thinking, analytical skills, and attention control.  
- **Mitigation:** Training cognitive resilience  
  - Sometimes, we want to rush and catch the threat actor quickly, but we should have mindfulness and attention control. Slowing down and practicing sustained attention will help us avoid acting impulsively.  
  - Having selective attention allowed me to apply contextual analysis and catch the different tone and language that was used in the message such as, “…We're running out of fun ideas for intro flags, so this one is uhh,…” The message was fun and almost flirty or was it? We have to catch these subtle clues. Is the threat actor trying to sound down to earth? Don’t fall for the trick, but also don’t overanalyze and waste time eating that submarine sandwich.
