### P2. Hidden Challenges

**Points:** 30  
**Level:** Simple  
**Category:** Tutorial  

**Description:**  
Following a narrative means some challenges could spoil earlier ones, so most challenges will be hidden at the beginning. Letting yourself bounce between the offensive and defensive challenges should prevent you from getting stuck. As you complete challenges, more will be unlocked - this also helps you get a feel for how an attack would actually unfold!  

**Objective / Challenge:**  
Obtain the flag by finding the hidden message spelled out in the instructions and combine the first letter in each sentence.  

**Tools Used:**  
Cognitive tools: CEO of the brain, working memory, selective attention  

**Methodology + Solution:**  
This was another challenge that required reading the instructions carefully and paying close attention to details while analyzing the information. I immediately noticed the first letter in each sentence was in bold and highlighted. I knew something was off and kept that detail in mind as I continued to read through the instructions. Once finished, I was able to quickly go back and jot down each letter that I noticed earlier to obtain the flag. The lesson here is to follow your intuition. If something is off, make a note of it as it just might be the answer to your flag.  

**Flag:**  
`FLAG`  

**Mitre Att&ck:**  
- **Tactic:** Reconnaissance (TA0043); Discovery (TA0007); Collection (TA0009)  
- **Techniques:** 1. Actively scanning the targetâ€™s message to identify any messages that appear a bit off. 2. Discovering files that may have sensitive data. 3. Capturing and storing the data obtained from the message.  
- **Procedures:** As the defender, I performed analysis to gather intelligence to prevent the attack. My discovery process entailed revealing the artifacts (individual letters) and collecting the evidence to understand its full scope and perform forensics.
